This repository is dedicated to assignments and problems related to the Queue data structure. The main source of these assignments is the document 'Assignment_3_Queue.pdf', which contains the assignment questions. The assignment is divided into two tasks.
<br>
In 'Arr.cpp', the Queue ADT is implemented using a circular array-based list, the implementation of which can be found in 'Arr_list.cpp'. This forms part of Task 1. Similarly, 'LL.cpp' implements the Queue ADT using a linked list-based list, with the implementation in 'LL_list.cpp'. This is also part of Task 1. The main function for Task 1 is contained in 'Task1.cpp'.
<br>
Task 2 involves the implementation of a Stack using a Queue. 'Stack.h' is the header file for the queue used in implementing the stack, and 'Stack.cpp' contains the implementation of the Stack. The main function for Task 2 is in 'Task2.cpp'.
<br>
The documents 'Queue_A1_A2.pdf', 'Queue_B1_B2.pdf', and 'Queue_C1_C2.pdf' contain three simple problems that require the use of the Queue data structure. The solutions to these problems can be found in 'Online_A.cpp', 'Online_B.cpp', and 'Online_C.cpp', respectively.
